        Eclipse Campout and Work Party
      </h1>
      <h2>April 6th - April 14th</h2>
      <div>
        <div>We are planning an epic week-long event in April 2024. You can sign up below to come and camp out at our property in Northeast Arkansas for a week or longer.</div>
        <div>This is a great networking opportunity, as well as a chance to check out land in the area. You can meet fellow friends and families who care about our future! There will be talks and activities, discussion groups, and work parties.</div>
        <div>We have a large property purchased as a group, and while each individual has their own private land, we have a community area that is developed and maintained in common to serve the families living on our more than 40 parcels. We hope that this will be the first of many such private neighborhoods in this region.</div>
        <div>We are planning to build a Viking-style longhouse in our community area, and will need many hands to help us build the stone foundation. We will also need people to help cook the food for everyone. Able-bodied men and women, in the spirit of community service, will be naturally inclined to help, as we will have work parties scheduled in between the many fun events.</div>
        <div>Only Ozarks PMA members will be allowed to attend this event (unless you have received a special exemption) <a

            class="ignore"
          >so if you haven't applied yet, please do!</a> There are many benefits to being a PMA member, not just the ability to participate in the RTTL: Ozarks group land buys.</div>
        <div>This is a family-friendly event so please feel free to bring your family.</div>
        <div>There will be a small cost to cover food which we will provide, and other amenities. This is listed in the sign-up form.There are motel options 20 minutes away, but because of the eclipse they are probably fully booked. Tent, RV or camper is fine at our property. Plan your travels to Northeast Arkansas in the Pocahontas area.</div>
